# Lead-Management-Platform-Data-Analysis-Dashboarding-InternPulse-Project-
## Project Objective
- This project was carried out in collaboration with a team of Product Managers as part of my internship at InternPulse. The goal was to support the development of a mobile-first lead management platform for Nigerian SMEs and enterprises by ensuring that lead, follow-up, and sales data was properly captured, structured, and transformed into actionable insights.

- As Data Analysts, our role included:
1. Designing a structured database schema for lead and sales data.
2. Capturing and organizing leads, follow-ups, and conversions from multiple sources.
3. Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover lead pipeline gaps, follow-up inefficiencies, and sales patterns.
4. Building dashboards to visualize lead pipeline stages, conversion rates, follow-up efficiency, and sales performance.
5. Providing data-driven insights that informed the Product Managers’ PRD (Product Requirement Document) and feature prioritization.

This project demonstrates how data analysis, visualization, and collaboration with product teams can help create smarter solutions for real business problems faced by SMEs in Nigeria and across Africa.

## Tools used
-	Excel (Power Query, PivotTables, Slicers).
## Process
- I Verified data for any missing values and anomalies and sorted out the same.
- I made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- I created Pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- I merged all pivot tables into one dashboard and applied slicers to make it dynamic and interactive.

## KEY INSIGHTS
1. Customer seriousness is a major conversion barrier: 14 respondents highlighted that customers often don’t take their inquiries seriously, while others face delays in payment.
2. Missed follow-ups are costing potential conversions: 6 respondents admitted forgetting to follow up on time, and 3 noted lack of reminders/automation as a challenge.
3. High reliance on WhatsApp & referrals for lead generation: WhatsApp (26) and referrals (21) are the most effective channels, far ahead of TikTok (13) and walk-ins (6).
4. Customer loss is frequent and recurring: 16 respondents lose customers monthly, while 11 lose them a few times a year.

##RECCOMMENDATIONS
1. Introduce a qualification step for leads (e.g., short screening or pre-commitment offers) to filter out unserious prospects before investing too much effort.
2. Implement a CRM or reminder tool (like HubSpot, Zoho, or even WhatsApp Business auto-reminders) to automate follow-ups and ensure consistent customer engagement.
3. Double down on these strong-performing channels; Optimize WhatsApp communication (quick replies, catalogues) and formalize referral programs with incentives.
4. Create a customer retention strategy; Loyalty programs, periodic check-ins, and flexible pricing packages to sustain interest and reduce churn.

Recommendation: Create a customer retention strategy — loyalty programs, periodic check-ins, and flexible pricing packages to sustain interest and reduce churn.
- Act on insights: Use the dashboard for quick, data-driven business decisions.
